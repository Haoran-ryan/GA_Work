// Sum Some Arrays

// Write a function that receives two arguments, both of which are Arrays and returns their sum.

//     These arrays contain only numbers.
//     You don't know their length and they can contain both integers and floating point numbers.

// Example:

// const array1 = [2, 6.4, 3];
// const array2 = [3, 3.6, 2];

// sumArrays(array1, array2) // => 20

// Bonus

// Create another version of the above function that can accept more than two arrays as the arguments.

// (you don't know the specific number of arguments).

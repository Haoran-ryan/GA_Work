# Pig Latin
Create a function in JS that will translate your input to Pig Latin!

### Your function:
- Must move the first letter of each word to the end of it, then add "_ay_" to the end of the word.
- Must Leave punctuation marks untouched.
- Doesn't need to be case sensitive.

### The input:
- Will have a space between words and punctuation, like in the example below. 

_note: It's fine for your output to keep the space between punctuation marks and the word._

### Examples:
``` JS
pigLatin("Pig Latin is cool !"); // => "igPay atinLay siay oolcay !"
pigLatin("When do we get back from break ?"); // => "henWay oday eway etgay ackbay romfay reakbay ?"
pigLatin("DRY code is good code ."); // => "RYDay odecay siay oodgay odecay ."
```

#### Bonus:
Go do some code wars or something...
